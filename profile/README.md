## About The Project

Analyzing data from the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency (BPS), it is evident that a substantial portion of the population needs to gain awareness about recycling. The statistics reveal a prevailing trend of low awareness among Indonesian households regarding the segregation of easily decomposable and non-decomposable waste. 

We've all witnessed the consequences of neglecting our environmentâ€”overflowing landfills, polluted oceans, and the detrimental impact on our health. In our journey to address Indonesia's waste management challenges, we identified three key issues. This led us to develop TrashSure. We aim to empower individuals with a simple yet effective tool for sorting and managing their trash, promoting sustainable habits that align with Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 12.

Welcome to TrashSure, your smart solution for sustainable living. Our team, represented by our distinctive logo and visual identity, is proud to introduce an app designed to transform the way we handle waste. With cutting-edge features and a user-friendly interface, TrashSure empowers individuals to make informed choices and contribute to sustainable living practices.
